<h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>  

> The main objective of this project is use Python involves building a conversational agent that can interact with users in natural language. 
>
> There are several libraries and frameworks available in Python that can help you build a chatbot, such as ChatterBot.
>
> ChatterBot is a popular open-source solution for building a chatbot in Python, which combines language corpora, text processing, machine learning algorithms, and data storage and retrieval to allow you to build flexible chatbots.
>
> So, we can build an industry-specific chatbot by training it with relevant data.

<h3>FOLLOW UP</h3>

To create a chatbot using Python, you can follow these steps:

- Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

- Create a working command-line chatbot using a library like ChatterBot.

- Train the chatbot to customize its responses by preparing relevant training data.

- Export and clean conversational data to train the chatbot.

- Retrain the chatbot with industry-specific data.

<h3>REFERENCES</h3>

We needed any kind of references to provide a comprehensive perception to building chatbots using Python, including the basics of natural language processing, collecting and training data for the chatbot, building the chatbot from scratch as a web app, integrating the chatbot with platforms like Facebook, Slack, and Telegram, and deploying the chatbot on your own server.

Here are the book that might be helpful for chatbot development using Python:

<h3>“Building Chatbots with Python: Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning” by Sumit Raj</h3>

1. This book covers different approaches to chatbot development, including key points on chatbot integration and deployment. It also employs machine learning to configure your chatbots.
2. And this book is available on Google Books and provides an introduction to chatbots, their architecture, and natural language processing with the natural language toolkit (NLTK) for building a custom language processing platform for your chatbot.
